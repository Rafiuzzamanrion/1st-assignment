            <h1 class="text">Bangladesh floods - urgent appeal</h1>
            <p>Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk,
                threatened by a high risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded
                into emergency flood shelters. Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring
                relief. Roads and homes have been submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools have been
                closed or impacted. </p>

            <p>The extreme flooding has caused heartbreaking damage across north-eastern Bangladesh putting 1.6 million
                children at risk. UNICEF is working with government and local partners to provide emergency supplies and
                services to those affected by floods. Children are in need, crowded in shelters for multiple days and
                facing a high risk of drowning.</p>

            <h1>Children and families need emergency supplies</h1>
            <p>7 year-old Sihab is one of the 1.6 million children affected by the floods that have devasted
                north-eastern Bangladesh this year. His entire village was hit with severe flooding following the
                rainfall, leaving his home underwater. His family is sheltering in a school building, without enough
                food. “I’ve only eaten dried rice with milk today because there are six of us and not enough rations for
                all of us,” Sihab says.</p>
